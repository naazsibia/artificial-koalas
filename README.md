## Installation Instructions:

The game can be played using this jar file on most machines running Java:

[DNACC.jar](https://github.com/naazsibia/artificial-koalas/raw/e1b43ff364dd17e00dcddc635aee9af231d049a6/DNACC.jar)

## How to Play:

1. A player (Player One or Player Two) can make a move when the corresponding label turns red. By default, 
Player One can move white pieces while Player Two can move black pieces. If it is not your turn, you will
not be able to select or move your pieces

2. To move a piece, click on the piece to select it. The spots where this piece can be moved will be highlighted.
Clicking on any of the highlighted spots will move your piece there, and turns will be switched so that the other 
player can make their move. You may not move a piece to a spot that is not highlighted

3. Once you are able to move a piece to the opponent's king's spot, you win the game and the game ends. If you
wish to play again, click "Play Again" in the pop-up window. If you want to stop playing, click "Quit."

There are a lot of chess rules that can be used to play. However, this game only follows the basic rule pattern
where each piece can only move to certain spots
